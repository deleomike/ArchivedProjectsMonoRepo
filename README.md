# Archived Code MonoRepo :book:

Welcome to my archive repo, whether this is me in the future or someone who came across this repo; *Welcome*.

This Monorepo is for many of my random projects.

They are not all notable, some are tutorials/small class assignments or notes on how to do things in C++/Java/Python.

There are a few notable mentions however.
- C++
  - [A MIPS Process Simulation in C++](./src/cpp/MIPS%20Processor/)
  - Communication and Control
    - [A Raspberry PI SPI Script](./src/cpp/Raspberry-Pi-SPI-slave/)
  - Algorithms
    - [Finite Impulse Response Filter](./src/cpp/FIR_FileOutput/)
    - [8 Bin FFT](./src/cpp/8BinFFT/)
    - [32 Bin FFT](./src/cpp/32binFFT_FileOutput/)
    - [Sorting Algorithms](./src/Coding%20Interview%20Prep/)
    - [Rudimentary AI Algorithms/Graph Search](./src/cpp/ai)
- Python
  - [My First Python Project in a Team Setting](./src/python/myfirstProject/)
- Java
  - [Multi-Threaded Webserver](./src/java/Multi-Thread-Web-Server/)
  - [Perceptron Written from Scratch](./src/java/Neural%20Network/)
    - Also available [here](https://github.com/deleomike/Perceptron)

Back then, all my C++ projects were done in Xcode because that was the only IDE I liked for Mac. That also means there is some configuration bloat in these subfolders.
